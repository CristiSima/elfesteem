Linear Rules
Needed e.g. for IP, for payload length.
This will allow to detect padding at the end of IP(str(IP(len=20))+'\0')

Layer bindings
Implementing it as rules should be feasible

Extend ELF implementation

Extend ME implementation

Begin PE implementation
This will probably need ad hoc hooks and hopefully not huge code changes.
